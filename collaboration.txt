When I moved to Alaska, I thought I would live a solitary life.  Then one day shortly after arriving, I was walking by Crescent Harbor when two children from St. Peter's rolled by on their bikes, waved at me, and said "Hi, Chip!"  Suddenly I knew that I belonged to a community.  It turns out that "No man (sic) is an island" is never more true than when you live on one.  Sitka is a tightly knit community, and St. Peter's is one of the ties that binds us together.

I see collaboration that produces community in the efforts of St. Peter's clergy, vestry. and laity to not only keep the doors of the church open, but to continue to make it a vibrant place of transformation, growth, and outreach.  In cooperation with other local churches, we bring food to the hungry on Sunday afternoon Manna Meals.  We support the Sitka Homeless Coalition's meals program and the Salvation Army's food pantry.  We open the See House for many community activities and programs.  Our licensed lay worship leaders and other volunteers in the church take part of the load off the clergy and the budget.  And we all gather together to remind ourselves that we are one body.

Working together cooperatively requires the humility and love to which Christ calls us.  We must be aware of our individual limitations so that we don't try to play the hero and get burned out.  We must look for opportunities to use our individual talents, not to impress, but to serve each other in love.  It all comes back to love.  Love binds us together in community.
