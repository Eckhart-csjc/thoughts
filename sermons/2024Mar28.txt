In a few moments we will follow Christ's command in our gospel lesson to wash each other's feet.  In this, we follow Christ's example -- but what does it mean?

First of all, it means lowering ourselves to the role of servant.  The humility of washing someone's feet says that we are not too good for that.  We set aside our self-importance for the good of someone else.  Conversely, it means that we exalt the other person.  We treasure them enough to do this for them.  In that respect, the relationship becomes one of caring for the other, much like a parent performs egoless tasks for their children -- or sometimes grown children perform the same tasks for their elderly parents.

There is an intimacy to foot-washing.  In our culture, we so often confuse intimacy with sexuality that many people never experience true intimacy: the touch of skin to skin in an act of care-giving that is not centered on selfish pleasure.

When Jesus took off his outer robe, wrapped a towel around himself, and began to wash his disciples' feet, he was acting out an analogy to the incarnation.  The Divine One, stripped of majesty, taking on the form of a servant in order to serve all of us.  Christ's humility was not about weakness, but rather an infinite strength.  Confidence enough to be abased.  Strength enough to be vulnerable.  Woundable, for our sakes.

Let us now do likewise for each other.
