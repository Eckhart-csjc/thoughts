It is all over now
And all that remains
Are the remains
And our duty to care for them.

Not to preserve
For to earth they must return
But to mourn 
Until we overcome

The numbness of our sudden loss
And truly feel our pain.
Half our grief at least
Is knowing that nothing we can do
Can undo What has happened.

We hoped for so much
We thought it had arrived!
Then in one dark day
Our whole world crashes down.
Even the sun ceases to shine.

The honored head
That spoke such wisdom
Now crowned with mocking thorns.
The heart so full of love

Now pours out water and blood.
The hands and feet
To which we looked for change
Mangled in the machinery
Of keeping things the same.

So we take the body down
From its place of public shame
Down to ourselves
We wrap it in a linen shroud

As if we could comfort it
Or hide its hideousness
We pack it with spice
So we won't bear its stench

Then we lay it in a tomb
And securely close the door
So we won't have to see it
Anymore.

But grief is not so easily buried
It will haunt our days
Until it has its say
Now is the time
To sit in our darkness
And wait.

For hope is not so easily murdered
Although it may seem 
Forever gone
After the darkness at the end of the world
Another day arises
