Triduum


Thursday

Washing feet
Intimacy of skin to skin
Care like a mother
Humility of a slave
Confidence enough to be abased
Strength enough to be vulnerable
Woundable

Gently touch the spot on each foot
Where soon your own will feel the nail


Friday

Were you there when they crucified him?
Did you participate?
Did you call for Barabbas?
Did you shout "Crucify!?"

Did you watch his mother weep?
His mother, the first to claim
He's not illegitimate
He's divine

When he said "It is finished"
What was completed 
In you?
What was just begun?


Saturday

God is dead
Your hope
Your source of joy
Shown to be a sham
Overcome by the meaningless
Tortured
Killed
And buried.

Now what?
There is nothing to do but wait
Wait through the night
To see what sun will rise tomorrow
